# Forward and Inverse Kinematics Problem

This file will show how to run the inverse and forward kinematics problem. The code have been set up with the PUMA560 robot. You can find the DH table have already been setup and the problem defined in the lab handout. User just needs to run these to main files: 

- ```main_inverse.m``` to see the PUMA robot solving the inverse kinematics problem defined in the lab
- ```main_forward.m``` to see the PUMA robot solving the forward kinematics problem defined in the lab


Enjoy!
